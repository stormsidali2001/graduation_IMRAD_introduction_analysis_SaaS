# IMRaD Introduction Analysis Platform (Next.js Microservice)

This repository contains the Next.js-based frontend and API for a Micro SaaS platform designed to analyze the introductions of scientific research papers based on the IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) structure.

## Project Overview

The platform uses state-of-the-art AI models to automatically classify sentences in introductions into their corresponding IMRaD moves and sub-moves. It provides:

* **Automated Analysis:**  Accurately identify and categorize sentences within research paper introductions.
* **Visual Feedback:** Highlight sentences and label them with their predicted moves and sub-moves.
* **Premium Features:**  Offer advanced features like summarization and author thought process analysis for paid subscribers. 
* **User-Friendly Interface:**  Provide an easy-to-use web interface for researchers, students, and educators to analyze introductions and improve their scientific writing. 

## Microservice Architecture

The platform is built using a microservice architecture for scalability and maintainability. This repository is the main microservice, responsible for the frontend user interface, user authentication, API endpoints, and orchestration of other microservices.

**Other Microservices:**

* **User Data Microservice:**  [https://github.com/stormsidali2001/imrad_introduction_moves_sub_moves_express_user_data](https://github.com/stormsidali2001/imrad_introduction_moves_sub_moves_express_user_data)
    * Built with Express.js and TypeScript.
    * Stores user data, analyzed introductions, predictions, summaries, and user feedback. 
    * Manages the feedback system. 

* **AI Models and PDF Extractor Microservices:**  [https://github.com/stormsidali2001/imrad_intros_moves_submoves_python_microservices](https://github.com/stormsidali2001/imrad_intros_moves_submoves_python_microservices)
    * **AI Models Microservice:**
        * Built with FastAPI (Python).
        * Handles interaction with the AI models, predictions, summarization, and thought process generation.
    * **PDF Extractor Microservice:**
        * Built with FastAPI (Python).
        * Extracts introductions from PDF research papers. 

**Additional Components:**

* **TensorFlow Serving:** Deployed using Docker, serves the AI models for prediction. (Docker Compose configuration is in the AI Models Microservice repository).
* **Redis:**  Used as a message broker for asynchronous communication between microservices.

## Datasets

The AI models in this platform are trained on a unique dataset of over 169,000 sentences. This dataset was generated using Google's Gemini Pro model and a custom-designed pipeline applied to a set of randomly selected introductions from the **unarXive IMRaD Classification Dataset (Hugging Face):** [https://huggingface.co/datasets/saier/unarXive_imrad_clf](https://huggingface.co/datasets/saier/unarXive_imrad_clf).

The pipeline involved the following steps:

1. **Introduction Selection:**  A set of introductions were randomly selected from the unarXive dataset. 
2. **Sentence Splitting with Gemini Pro:**  Gemini Pro was used to split each selected introduction into individual sentences. 
3. **Initial Move and Sub-move Prediction (Gemini Pro):** Gemini Pro was used to generate initial predictions for the IMRaD move and sub-move of each sentence. 
4. **Outlier Detection:** A custom outlier detection pipeline analyzed the initial predictions, identifying and removing sentences with likely incorrect classifications. 
5. **Data Augmentation with Gemini Pro:** For each IMRaD move label, additional sentences were generated using Gemini Pro, based on the correctly classified sentences remaining after outlier detection.

This process resulted in a final dataset of over 169,000 sentences, meticulously labeled for their respective IMRaD moves and sub-moves.

**Dataset Generation Notebooks:**

The notebooks used to create this dataset can be found in the `/notebooks` directory of this repository. 

**Trained Models:**

The trained TensorFlow models are published on Hugging Face:
